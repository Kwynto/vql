# You can support the development of VQL.


## Usage.
The most important support for VQL is the use of this language in real projects.  
If you can include VQL support in your project, then do it.  
Tell the author of this repository that your project supports VQL, and I will put your project in the "**Projects that support VQL**" section.  


## Recommendations
If you are not a developer of data processing tools, then you can simply put a star to this repository. Or you can tell your friends about the existence of VQL.  
Such support is also very important for the development of this language. This will have a positive effect on your karma.  


## Sponsorship
And finally, there is another way to help the project.  
This is direct financial assistance for any amount.  
Financial assistance can be anonymous or public. I can put your name, the name of your company or its logo in the "**Thanks for the help**" section.  

You can make your donations for the development of open and free software in Bitcoin.
